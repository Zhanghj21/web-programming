            At 23:30 on September 19 (Beijing time), the fifth round of the Premier League ushered in a focus war. Tottenham Hotspur played Chelsea at home. In the first half, Christensen shot angrily to create danger, and Sun Xingqian half stabbed and shot at the door, which was resolved by Capa. In the second half, Tiago Silva snatched a header to break the deadlock. Later, Kanter suddenly hit Dell's foot with a cold arrow and refracted it into the net. Werner's assist in Ludige's strafe in the extra time stage made it even better. Finally, Tottenham lost 0-3 at home to Chelsea and suffered two consecutive league defeats.
